HELLO EVERYONE :)

Here we will understand how to use the software created to run any application using just one call on TRIGGER CMD,
In this repository, you can find two other files,
One is the executable (.exe) and the other is the cod in extension (.waj),
If you need to modify, you will need to obtain a license on the WIN AUTOMATION software.

--------------------- HOW TO USE THE EXECUTIBLE ---------------------

To use automation, you need to download the executable, save the file in any directory. 
On your TRIGGER CMD, you need to create a new TRIGGER by passing the file path and enabling the parameter option. 
To call an application, just write the file path in front of this automation string path as if it were a parameter.

Example: C: \ ... \ ... \ automation_run_application.exe "C: ... \ ... \ Teams.exe" "C: ... \ ... \ WinAutomation.Console.exe" "C : ... \ ... Ssms.exe "" C: ... \ ... \ automation_run_application.exe F "

Remember, use the ("") for each parameter, because if there is any space in the string, TRIGGER CMD will be understood as a new parameter

--------------------- ALEXA AUTOMATION ---------------------

The most amazing thing you can do is to perform this automation using your alexa, but you need to use some plug-ins to do this,

First - Search for TRIGGER CMD in your browser and follow all the steps ...

--------------------- WHY TO USE ---------------------

If you’re using the TRIGGER CMD, you’ve probably realized that we can’t call more than one trigger per minute,
So I create this application.
My idea was to create a routine to open all the applications I use daily, but I had to wait a minute for the calls, but with this software, I can just make a call on the TRIGGER CMD and perform any automation
